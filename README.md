# Install Web Server

Feel free to use your own web server, but for convenience we've bundled a basic node server. To use it, make sure you have Node/NPM/Yarn

1. yarn install
2. node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8080

# What we're looking for

Turn this into something you'd be proud of. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Is it visually appealing?
- Is it performant?
- Is it responsive?
- Is the UX sensible?
- Is the code efficient?
- Is the code easy to read?
- Is the code maintainable?
- Does it have any bugs?
- Is it well tested?

Feel free to make any changes you want to it. **Own** it. The only thing it _must_ do is to display the list of books, their cover image, title, and author. If you want to add more functionality, rearrange the layout, whatever, that's totally fine and up to you.

Remember that this exercise is about _building a product_, and not just _writing code_.

Also, note that there are some deliberate poor design/coding choices that have been made here. It is expected that you will improve upon them.  

### Requirements

- Vanilla JS - no jQuery, no React, no frameworks, no external libraries.
- Use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap 5 would be fine)
- Please provide commentary on changes and reasoning (in-code or separately)

### Time limit

There is no time limit. Submit only when you are proud of the work. However, please indicate how long you worked on it. We will be assessing balance between polish and execution speed.
